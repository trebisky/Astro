Astronomical calculations -

ephem  -- a C program to calculate things like sunrise/set and moonrise/set,
as well as other things needed to generate the MMT almanac.

almanac  --  the ancient Fortran code used to generate the MMT almanac.

haskell -- at one time I was fooling around translating (so to speak)
the old Fortran code into Haskell.  This is an unfinished project that
is never likely to be finished.
