The files used to generate the MMT almanac have been
maintained by Tom Trebisky since perhaps 2005 or earlier.
The files used to be kept on Cholla (Tom's desktop machine).
Then they were moved to /mmt on hacksaw, and now they
are kept in /mmt which is network mounted from our
NAS box "nas1", which is on the mountain (as of 2012).

You will need f77 (aka g77) to build the fortran
as of fedora 25, you do this to get it:

    dnf install compat-gcc-34-g77

You also need enscript:

    dnf install enscript

----------------------------------------

To make the almanac for a new year, do this:

	0) cd /mmt/almanac
	1) mkdir <new_year>
	2) cp <last_year>/* to <new_year>
	3) cd <new_year>
	4) make clean
	5) then do all the stuff below

Then you should see these files:

    Makefile - just what you would think,
		EDIT to change year filenames (05>>06)
    Readme - the file you are reading, not normally
    		needing changes, unless you discover
		something new.

    almn.proto - read only - the prototype fortran code.

    header - header text, EDIT to change dates.

    mkdata - EDIT this like crazy based on the comments
    		contained therein.
		(this took about 30 minutes in 2006, with
		the almanacs for both 2006 and 2007 in hand).

    mksrc - should need no changes.
    mktxt - should need no changes.

After editing header and mkdata, you just invoke the Makefile.

	"make all" will then do it

Also, Marilyn (or Barbara) needs the value of ANEWM to plug into a
spreadsheet of hers.  I just yank it out of a data statement in the
almn06.f file.  In 2006 the value is/was 28.2951388888889
(This is the day of the first new moon at Greenwich).

Also send Marilyn the PDF copy of the schedule.

-------------------------------------------

In October 2006, I began studying and adding comments to the program.
(This was triggered by a bug on October 28, 2006 where the moonset
time was identical to that for October 29, namely 0:02, whereas it
should have been about 22:50  All other entries for that day look OK).

John Glaspey recommended the "skycal" program as a good tool to use
for cross-checking our almanac.  Source code seems to be available
in C, Python, Java, and a Tkinter(Python) front end is available.

skycal is at:

 ftp://iraf.noao.edu/contrib/

 See  http://www.dartmouth.edu/~physics/faculty/thorstensen.html

There are rumors (ill founded, I think) that our program traces back to
some older version of skycal (which was written by John R. Thorstensen at
Dartmouth), but after looking at the source code for both, I can see no
trace of anything in common.

i.e. I have no clue where our old fortran code came from.

-------------------------------------------

Note that we compile this with f77 which is g77.  I am tempted to
bypass the 72 column fortran standard with the following g77 option:
(regression tests will be necessary).

-ffixed-line-length-n
   Set column after which characters are ignored in typical fixed-form lines in
   the source file, and through which spaces are assumed (as if padded to that
   length) after the ends of short fixed-form lines.

   Popular values for n include 72 (the standard and the default), 80 (card image),
   and 132 (corresponds to ''extended-source'' options in some popular compilers).
   n may be none, meaning that the entire line is meaningful and that continued
   character constants never have implicit spaces appended to them to fill out the
   line.  -ffixed-line-length-0 means the same thing as -ffixed-line-length-none.

THE END
